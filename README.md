# __[hodl.watch](https://hodl.watch)__
Extensible web application for crypto portfolio tracking. With charts!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The main idea behind this project is to create portfolio tracking web application which is easy to use, easy to modify or extend and where user is an owner of his own data. That means everyone can make a fork of this project and run it in his own environment. Or they can just use the hosted app at [hodl.watch](https://hodl.watch)

## __Work In Progress__



# Features

## Advanced charting

## Automatic exchange data import
Thanks to awesome [ccxt](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) library it has become fair simple to support many exchanges through unified API.

## Private data storage
The app stores all its data in browser localstorage, not sending it to any third party. 
One of the planned features is adding dropbox sync so that user can work with the same data on many devices.

## Easy to modify
hodl.watch being powered by React and Redux which is one of the most popular stacks
in recent web development. That reduces the difficulty of having to learn a new technology for many developers.
The code is written using well known best practises to stay readable and not difficult to modify or extend. 

A developer wiki is planned to provide some instructions about how to work with the project.
